## Abstract

* ❗️It’s certainly a pertinent question for investors and the public alike. A company like Undeads, boasting millions in investments and a significant market cap >$50mln for its coin, yet maintaining a high degree of public opacity, raises several red flags and questions about its operational model.

* Hard to find information about legal company, founders, C-Level, employees.

* [undeads.com](http://undeads.com) hides official personal and company information intentionally The Undeads.com website does not provide information about the jurisdiction of a legal company. The founders of undeads.com do not have public accounts in social networks under undeads.com label. The Undeads company LinkedIn profile has only one open employee profile. All others are closed including C-level.

@undeadscom ([https://x.com/undeadscom](https://x.com/undeadscom)) twitter discloses that a based Sezual Pte Ltd company is registered in Singapore.

Officially, the SEZUAL PTE. LTD. company is listed as a software developer, but it specifically excludes games, which is an unusual classification given its activities:

SEZUAL PTE. LTD. (the "Company") is an Exempt Private Company Limited by Shares, incorporated on 26 July 2010 (Monday) in Singapore. The address of the Company's registered office is at the [HONG LEONG BUILDING](https://www.sgpbusiness.com/building/HONG-LEONG-BUILDING/048581) building. The Company current operating status is live and has been operating for 1280129618. This Company's principal activity is development of software and applications (except games and cybersecurity).

**Key Principal:** YEOW LIH REN 

**Previous Company Name:** TELEOS CORPORATE PTE. LTD.

Until **Sezual Pte Ltd company** (_Singapore_) is considered as a main equity, the company **Undeads Interactive Limited** (_London_) is a publisher.

The Undeads LinkedIn account states about Headquarters in the United Arab Emirates.

[Undeads.com](http://undeads.com) has their own coin UDS that is listed on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com) and other crypto exchanges. Market Cap: ~$50M in June 2025.

The link: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/undeads-games/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/undeads-games/) 

Despite receiving millions in investments and their coin having a market cap of $50 million, [Undeads.com](http://undeads.com) lacks clear, official legal entity information. This makes determining the proper jurisdiction for complaints difficult, as various entities are mentioned: Sezual Pte Ltd (Singapore), Undeads Interactive Limited (London), and a headquarters in the UAE.

### Public faces of the company in [Undeads.com](http://undeads.com)

The publicly named founders of Undeads.com, **Grant Haseley** and **Leo Kahn**, do not appear to have official accounts in social networks directly affiliated with the "undeads.com" label.

* No searchable [X.com](http://x.com) accounts 

**Leo Kahn (Founder, CEO, USA)**

It's unusual for a company of Undeads' stated size (50+ employees) to have only one publicly visible employee profile on LinkedIn, with all others hidden or private (including accounts of C-level). This is atypical for businesses aiming for transparency and professional networking.
