With around $50 million (>40%) of the unlocked $UDS market cap under the control of n0b0dy.eth and indifferentguy.eth, there's a risk that these individuals could destabilize the $UDS coin at any time.

## Conclusions
* A single individual or a coordinated group, operating under the pseudonyms **n0b0dy.eth** and **indifferentguy.eth**, controls roughly 40% of the unlocked market capitalization. This significant concentration of holdings is a major risk for the UDS token holder community.
