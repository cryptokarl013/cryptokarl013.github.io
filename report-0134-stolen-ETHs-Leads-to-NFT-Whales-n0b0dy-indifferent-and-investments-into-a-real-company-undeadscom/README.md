A crypto detective named [@cryptokarl013](https://cryptokarl013.github.io) started a major investigation after a small theft of 100 ETH from [switchere.com](http://switchere.com). This led him to find relation that two big NFT whales, **n0b0dy** and **indifferentguy**, who are worth about $25 million and are well-known influencers, were connected to a real company called [undeads.com](http://undeads.com). That company has raised $6 million and its coin, **$UDS**, is worth about $50 million in July 2025.

The following is a series of smaller investigations that led to these significant conclusions:

## Abstract
In May 2022, over 100 ETH were stolen from a hot wallet of the [switchere.com](http://switchere.com) crypto exchange. 

By 2025, these stolen funds were traced to NFT whales __Indifferent.eth__ and __N0b0dy.eth__, who hold assets worth over $25 million.

## Conclusions
* **n0b0dy.eth** and **indifferent.eth** are connected with crypto thefts including the [switchere.com case](report-0134.0-crypto-theft-from-switchere.com-connected-with-nft-whales-n0b0dy.eth-and-indifferent.eth)

* **n0b0dy.eth** and **indifferent.eth** are managed by a single person or a coordinated group

* [Undeads.com](http://undeads.com), a legitimate company received more than **$2 million** in investments from **indifferent.eth** and **N0b0dy.eth** in pre-seed and seed rounds.

* [Undeads.com](http://undeads.com) has been funded with illicit money provided by investors **n0b0dy.eth** and **indifferent.eth**.

* **nobody.eth** and **indifferent.eth** are either the founders of Undeads.com or are closely connected with them. (_Investors put millions into a company only when they have strong confidence in its founders. The pre-seed and seed funding rounds only included two investors: Nobody.eth and Indifferent.eth._)

* **n0b0dy.eth** tries to hide the information about funding into [Undeads.com](http://undeads.com)

* **undeads.com** hides official company information intentionally (_unclear legal jurisdiction, no public accounts of C-Level, empty LinkedIn in profiles__). 

* In August 2025, over $40 million of the unlocked market capitalization for the __$UDS__ coin is tied to two NFT whale investors, **indifferentguy** and **n0b0dy**. This represents $40%$ of the total unlocked supply.
