### Theft fact

On May 27, 2022, Ethereum and 13 other EVM-compatible coins were transferred to a new, "clean" wallet [0x6981fe4eb847c9060861c24b3a1463ebd8b3c785](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6981fe4eb847c9060861c24b3a1463ebd8b3c78). The hot wallet was completely emptied within several hours.

The funds were withdrawn as a result of a hacker attack on switchere.com, after which the crypto exchange changed its hot wallets.
